# Temperature-Sensor-App
This project includes an Mx7 server for the microprocessor and the temperature probe connected to an Android Client with the use of a NetBeans Proxy Server.

This app is ran on Android Studio with the Mx7 Server running on MPLabIDE and the proxy server on NetBeans. Below is the GUI of the application.

The various buttons all interact with the Mx7 microprocessor and the temperature probe connected to it. We first establish a connection between the server and application using the proxy.

Once the connection is established, we can execute the get temperature command and see the temperature in the app.
